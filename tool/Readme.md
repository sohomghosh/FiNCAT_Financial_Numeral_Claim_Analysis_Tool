You can access the tool (with enhanced UI) directly from [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OEN48pPaEFAXiB972tYjC0Llfo0qrLcN?usp=sharing). Alternatively, you can run the FiNCAT_tool_enhanced_UI.ipynb notebook present in this folder.

You can also use the API directly from [HuggingFace & Gradio](https://hf.space/gradioiframe/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool/api)


For using the older version, you need to execute the FiNCAT_tool.ipynb notebook the present in the this folder. It needs fincat_utils.py present in the main folder and the lr_clf_FiNCAT.pickle artifact present in this folder. It requires: [utils code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool/main/fincat_utils.py) and [model artifact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool/main/tool/lr_clf_FiNCAT.pickle)
