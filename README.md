### The API is available [here](https://hf.space/gradioiframe/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool/api).

*For re-training or re-using the tool locally, please refer to requirements.txt for versions of the Python libaries used while developing this tool.*

<br>**Training**<br>
For training you need to execute the *FiNCAT_training.ipynb* notebook the present in the training folder. It needs *fincat_utils.py* present in the main folder and the embeddings/labels present in the training folder as .csv files. *X_train_df.zip* needs to be unzipped to get the X_train_df.csv file. You can obtain the raw data from [here](https://sites.google.com/nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/finnum3/data) .<br>

<br>**Using the tool locally**<br>
For using the tool locally, you do not need to train it as we have already provided the model artifacts. You can simply execute the [FiNCAT_tool_enhanced_UI.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/sohomghosh/FiNCAT_Financial_Numeral_Claim_Analysis_Tool/blob/main/tool/FiNCAT_tool_enhanced_UI.ipynb). More details have been provided in the tools folder.
